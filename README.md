# jscad projects

`jscad` is a _Programmers Solid 3D CAD Modeller_ based on java-script and inspired by the venerable [openSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) solid modeller.
Having tried both `scad` and `jscad`, i find jscad easier to work with because I can use java-scripts for all the logic and control flow, without having to learn yeat another DSL.

A simple way to work with jscad-files is to drag them into the viewer at `openjscad.org`. The web-page supports autoreload, so you can use a local editor.
